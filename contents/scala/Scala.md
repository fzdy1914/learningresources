# Overview
**Scala** is a *multi-paradigm*, *statically typed* programming language. 
It is designed to be a mixture of *Object-Oriented Programming* and *Functional Programming*. 

Scala is **statically typed**, which means it do type checking like verifying and enforcing the constraints of types 
at compile-time.

Scala is a **pure OOP language**, which means every value in it is an object, including functions and primitives.

Scala is not a **pure Functional Programming language**, but it contains many features of it including *currying*, 
*type inference*, *immutability*, *lazy evaluation*, and *pattern matching*.

# Getting Started
There are mainly two ways to work in Scala.

1. Using the **INTELLIJ IDE**. Refer to the [instructions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started-intellij-track/getting-started-with-scala-in-intellij.html) for more details.
2. Using the **command line**. Refer to the [instructions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started-sbt-track/getting-started-with-scala-and-sbt-on-the-command-line.html) for more details.
